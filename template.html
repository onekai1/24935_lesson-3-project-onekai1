        <h2>Austyn Ribble</h2>
        <p>My name is Austyn Ribble. I've been a student at the maricopa colleges for a while now, Rio Salado being the second college I've had to take classes from. I work and do school as best as I can though there are sometimes where I do falter because the stress of having to juggle such tough activites together really gets to me. Though, I do try my best as much as I can. I want to study as much as I can to really get into the field of IT and cybersecurity but one step at a time for me. Web design sounds really  fun so I am not just taking this class for the credit but also because it sounds like something I would really enjoy.</p>
